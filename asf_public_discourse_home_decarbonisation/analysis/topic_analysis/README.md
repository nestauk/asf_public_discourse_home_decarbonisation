# üõù Topic analysis - exploration

This folder contains scripts that helped us in our exploration of topic analysis.

You can open them as notebooks by running the following on your terminal:

```
pip install jupytext
jupytext --to notebook FILE_NAME.py
```

You can find the topic analysis pipeline scripts in `/pipeline/bert_topic_analysis/`.
