`python asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/pipeline/bert_topic_analysis/sentence_topic_analysis.py --source SOURCE --start_date START_DATE --end_date END_DATE --reduce_outliers_to_zero REDUCE_OUTLIERS_TO_ZERO --filter_by_expression FILTER_BY_EXPRESSION --min_topic_size MIN_TOPIC_SIZE`

where:

- SOURCE is the source of the data: `mse` or `buildhub`
- [optional] START_DATE is the start date of the analysis in the format YYYY-MM-DD
- [optional] END_DATE is the end date of the analysis in the format YYYY-MM-DD
- [optional] REDUCE_OUTLIERS_TO_ZERO is True to reduce outliers to zero. Defaults to False
- [optional] FILTER_BY_EXPRESSION is the expression to filter by. Defaults to 'heat pump'.
