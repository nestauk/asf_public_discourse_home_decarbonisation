# 🗣️🌿 Understanding Public Discourse on Home Decarbonisation 🌿🗣️

The `asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation` repository contains code to **analyse public discourse data from online forums** to identify:
- **Topics of conversation**: We use [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) (a topic modelling technique) to identify topics of conversation in online forum threads. We apply this to sentences from posts and replies and to forum post titles. We then manually rename these topics.

- **Frequently asked questions posted in the forum**: We collect questions asked in forum posts or replies, and apply BERTopic to identify similar groups of questions, leveraging [OpenAI's large language models](https://openai.com/) to create the final topic representations (i.e. our frequently asked questions).

- **Sentiment analysis of topics of conversation**: [`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) sentiment model is used to identify sentiment of sentences and topics (by aggregating the sentiment of sentences in specific topics). This allows us to identify issues raised by those posting in the forums, as well as identifying positive experiences.

- **How all the above change over time**: all sentences and posts are associated with a date/time so we can track how topics, sentiment and questions change over time.

For the purpose of this project, the analyses are focused on conversations about **home heating** and **home decarbonisation**. However, *the pipelines created here can be applied to any domain area*.

In the context of the 🌿 **[sustainable future mission](https://www.nesta.org.uk/sustainable-future/)** 🌿 work, the analyses in this codebase allow us to:
- understand the current barriers to installing low-carbon heating technologies, such as regulatory constraints or installation challenges with heat pumps, and identify the skills/training needed by heating engineers to help them transition to low carbon heating;
- identify unknown issues faced by homeowners when installing low carbon heating tech in their home and questions they typically have;
- identify the common misconceptions around low-carbon heating tech;
- identify frequently asked questions by engineers installing low carbon heating tech;
- track the dominant narratives about heat pumps (and other heating technologies) across online forums.

## 🆕 Latest analyses
This section highlights the latest analyses conducted that will feature in publishable outputs.

### ♨️ Heat pump topic & sentiment analysis: identifying topics of conversation in heat pump conversations and respective sentiment

#### Topic analysis identification
To identify topics of conversation in heat pump Money Saving Expert forum threads, we run:

```
python asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/pipeline/bert_topic_analysis/sentence_topic_analysis.py --source "mse" --start_date "2016-01-01" --end_date "2024-05-22" --filter_by_expression "heat pump"
```

To identify topics of conversation in heat pump Buildhub forum threads, we run:

```
python asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/pipeline/bert_topic_analysis/sentence_topic_analysis.py --source "buildhub" --start_date "2016-01-01" --end_date "2024-05-22" --filter_by_expression "heat pump"
```

The above will run the pipelines for topic analysis on sentence data, and the results will be saved to S3.

#### Sentiment analysis computation
To compute sentiment for sentences in the above topics, we run the following commands. These will save the sentiment results to S3.

For Money Saving Expert:
```
python asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/pipeline/sentiment/sentence_sentiment.py --source "mse" --filter_by_expression "heat pump" --start_date "2016-01-01" --end_date "2024-05-22"
```

For Buildhub:
```
python asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/pipeline/sentiment/sentence_sentiment.py --source "buildhub" --filter_by_expression "heat pump" --start_date "2016-01-01" --end_date "2024-05-22"
```

#### Analysis results: topics & sentiment

To visualise the results run the following command to explore the notebook:

```
pip install jupytext
jupytext --to notebook asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/analysis/final_analyses/2024_09_30_topics_and_sentiment.py
```

### 🏘 Home heating topic analysis: identifying size and growth of topics of conversation in the home heating domain
To identify topics of conversation in the home heating domain, we run the following
```
python asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/pipeline/bert_topic_analysis/title_topic_analysis.py --source "mse" --end_date "2024-05-22" --min_topic_size 300
```

This will take all post titles since 2003 and identify topics of conversation.

To visualise the results run the following command to explore the notebook:

```
pip install jupytext
jupytext --to notebook asf_public_discourse_home_decarbonisation/analysis/final_analyses/2024_09_30_home_heating_topics_and_changes_over_time.py
```
